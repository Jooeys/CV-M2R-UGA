### 1) What is a Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)? What function does it provide for the human
visual system?


The LGN acts as a filter for visual attention, surpressing information that the system
is not “attending” to (looking at). Surprisingly, 80% of the excitation of the LGN
comes from the visual cortext and other areas of the brain. 

### 2) What is the Superior Colliculus? What function does it provide for the human visual system?

The SC acts as both a relay station to communicate retinal maps to multiple parts of
the visual cortex, and as an attention filter, to suppress unattended information. The
LGN provides filtered "retinal maps" to the different visual cortexes as well as to the
SC. 


### 3) The human vision system can be described as a series of filters. Names as many filters as you
can, and briefly (one sentence) describe the role of each filter.




### 4) What is the difference between luminous flux and radiant flux?

- Radiant flux a measure of the total "amount" of light in the visible spectrum emitted
by a source. The unit of radiant flux can be thought of as a measure of the number of
photons of visible light within a beam or angle, or emitted from some source.
- Luminous flux (Lumens) is radiant flux adjusted for the wavelengths and sensitivity
of light sensed by the human retina. 1W = 683 lumens.

Luminous flux measures the number of photons perceivable by a human.
